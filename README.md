# Froy
self-assistant speech recognizer made in Python.
It has features like locking the device,playing songs on yotube,emptying recycle bin,search on google,playing music when bored,telling date and time when asked.
All these actions are performed upon recognizing the speech and interpreting as what to do with it.
I'll keep adding new features.
